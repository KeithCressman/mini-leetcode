# Mini-Leetcode
## By Keith Cressman


I made this project as part of a Christmas gift for my older brother. I hid my gift to him - in order to find the location, he had to correctly solve a programming puzzle on this mini-leetcode site. 

* To run the web server (made with next.js), simply run 
  * npm run dev
* You will also need to run the Python engine (a Flask server which creates subprocesses to run the code submissions) to check if the code submissions works - simply run 
  * python pythonRunner.py
* From there, you can access the mini-leetcode site in your browser and try solving the coding puzzle!
